NEW INSTALLATION:

- Plugins can be installed automatically through the admin area of your script installation.
- Login to the admin area
- Select plugins, add plugin.
- Attach the downloaded zip file and click 'upload plugin package'.
- Once uploaded, you can install and configure the plugin settings.

- If the above process fails, you can manually upload the plugin. Via FTP, go into the plugins folder on your install. Create a new folder named the same as the $pluginConfig['folder_name'] value in _plugin_config.inc.php. i.e. authorize or mediaplayer etc. Upload the plugin files to this folder. Reload the plugin manager via your script admin to see the plugin listed.


UPGRADES:

- Backup your existing files and database.
- Re-upload all the plugin code to replace your existing code in the plugins/[plugin_name]/ folder.
- Apply any database changes between your plugin version numbers (if they exist). These can be found here:
  plugins/[plugin_name]/offline/upgrade_sql_statements/

Note: Your plugin version number can be found in plugins/[plugin_name]/_plugin_config.inc.php
